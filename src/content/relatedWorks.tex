\chapter{Related Work}

There are numerous verification and validation tools available, with \texttt{CPAchecker} and \texttt{UAutomizer}
being among the most prominent, including \texttt{Theta}. Both are classified as static validators, meaning
they analyze the program without actual execution, unlike dynamic validators ~\cite{witness1}. We will now compare
our solution to these two established validators.

It is well known that \texttt{CPAchecker} employs its Configurable Program Analysis (CPA) framework for
both verification of programs and the validation of witnesses. For violation witness validation, \texttt{CPAchecker}
executes a composite CPA. This typically includes a LocationCPA, two AutomatonCPA instances (one
for the observer automaton representing the specification, and another for the witness automaton),
and potentially further CPAs like an IntervalCPA to provide specific analysis capabilities ~\cite{witness1}.
The program is initially parsed into a Control-Flow Automaton (CFA). Subsequently, the CPA
algorithm is run on this CFA, guided by the witness and specification automata, and the
validation results are then outputted.

Compared to our \texttt{Theta} validator, the \texttt{CPAchecker} validator possesses a broader range of features
and handles both violation and correctness witnesses. Furthermore, \texttt{CPAchecker} supports witness
refinement, a capability our current validator does not offer.

On the other hand, \texttt{UAutomizer}, when validating violation witnesses, utilizes a technique quite
similar to the one implemented in our \texttt{Theta} validator. It effectively creates a product of the
program's automaton (CFA) and the witness automaton ~\cite{witness1}.
When compared to our validator, \texttt{UAutomizer} is a more complete tool, providing more features,
including the significant capability of supporting correctness witnesses.
