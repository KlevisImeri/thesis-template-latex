\chapter{Conclusion}

With the exploding volume of software being produced, the necessity for robust testing and
verification has reached an unprecedented scale. However, formal verification tools often
lag in possessing the necessary features to enhance their practical applicability in industry.
To address issues such as compatibility among these verification tools, witnesses were
introduced as a form of certificate. The underlying concept was to establish a standard
method for expressing verification results, while also incorporating additional information
to expedite the validation process. Initially, Witness 1.0 was introduced, subsequently
followed by the development of Witness 2.0. The Theta modeling framework, despite its
rich feature set, previously lacked a validator for Witness 2.0; consequently, our
objective was to develop one. This paper lays the foundational groundwork for such a
validator. Although the validator currently supports only a limited range of features,
we anticipate its future expansion into a comprehensive, feature-rich, state-of-the-art tool.

\section{Future work}

As discussed in the limitations section, numerous features are currently absent and will require
eventual implementation. This paper primarily details the algorithms for violation
Witness 2.0. In contrast, a substantial amount of work remains for the development
and explanation of correctness witness validation.
Furthermore, an important feature that our Theta validator currently does not support, but which
may be incorporated in future development, is witness refinement.
